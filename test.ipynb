Someone might think that light cannottravel 300,000 kilometres per second faster than each rocket, becausethe light beam would then have two speeds. But that would be a con-tradiction – light cannot have two different speeds. What is wrongwith this reasoning? Einstein was able to remove the appearance of contradiction by profoundly altering our view of time. To understand this, we mustcarefully reconsider what a contradiction would be. Plato andAristotle were apparently the first to state what is, perhaps, the mostfundamental idea in philosophy: The law of non-contradiction: Opposite properties do not belong',\n",

It can be black here and white there and “read”throughout. It cannot be black and white at the same point since thesecolours are opposites. (Lukasiewicz calls this the “ontological”version of Aristotle’s law: it is about properties and things. Otherversions of the law concern true sentences or psychological states likebelief.) In a move of breathtaking audacity, Einstein reasoned that, since there were no real contradictions, and therefore a light beam cannothave two speeds in the same respect and at the same time , the two rockets above must have different times .

Although the jets flew much more slowly than the speedof light, there was still a measurable time dilation. The clocks wereslightly behind other clocks that remained in the laboratory, just asEinstein’s theory predicted. This can be tested at home. For example, time dilation can be used to delay getting the wrinkled hands that accompany ageing. If bothhands are simply flapped up and down continuously at nearly thespeed of light, they will remain young while the rest of your bodyages.

Thus, during inertial motion the ship is lazy in the sense that it justkeeps doing what it was doing: it does not change speed or direction. The opposite of inertial motion is accelerated motion , and that is easy to detect. For example, when a car accelerates, the passengers arepushed back against their seats.

Interestingly, a ray of light is pure energy and has no rest mass at all. Thus if the rest mass is zero, then multiplying by 2 or 20,000 orinfinity will still leave zero. A multiple of zero is still zero. Unlikeordinary bodies, light can travel at the maximum speed withoutbecoming infinitely heavy.

In classicalphysics before Einstein, these were regarded as fundamental. Butwhen mass is converted into energy, the total amount of mass in theuniverse decreases just as the total amount of energy increases. Thusneither total is conserved. To save the general idea of conservation,physicists combined the two laws. After Einstein, they said that thetotal amount of mass and energy together is conserved when allmeasurements are made by the same set of rulers and clocks.

Gravity tries to pull the body down evenfaster, but the air pushes back and prevents any more acceleration.The body plummets downwards at a constant velocity, whichphysicists call (no pun) its “terminal velocity”. There is an alternative interpretation of this. Instead of saying that the resistance of the air increases with the body’s speed we could insistthat the mass of the body increases with the body’s speed.

That is why its acceleration dwindles to zero even though the downward force on itstays the same. In fact, at the maximum, terminal velocity, we couldsay that the body is infinitely heavy, since it no longer responds to theforce of gravity at all.

According to one set, aspacetime interval may appear short in space and long in time, butanother set may find it long in space and short in time.

But these lengths are relations  between the three-dimensional shape of the statue and certain lines. If we chose different lines to be our axes, then the“length along the x-axis” would change. In short, “length along the x- axis” is not a property that depends only on the individual statue; it isa relation between the statue and a direction.

Likewise, in four-dimensional space, thefour-dimensional volume is duration multiplied by length multiplied bybreadth multiplied by height. Thus a tennis match may take three hoursand fill a tennis court, and we can calculate the four-dimensional volumeof this event. This region of spacetime has an invariant volume, eventhough the length of the court and the duration of the match are relativeto the clocks and rulers used to measure them.

The minority interpretation accepts, of course, the fact that the spacetime interval is invariant, but it interprets it as a mathematicalaccident. Movement through the ether causes lengths to contract andclocks to slow.

There is no physical “evolution” through time, that is, no change orpersistence; instead, a static four-dimensional block exists.

The existence of anobjective lapse of time, however, means that reality consists of aninfinity of layers of “now” which come into existence succes-sively.

Some 5,000 or 6,000 years ago, early societies living in T urkey and Armenia spoke Indo-European: the language from which modernEuropean languages have descended. Their vocabulary for concreteobjects and simple actions paints a vivid picture of prehistoric life : “bear”, “wolf”, “monkey”, “wheat”, “apple”, “wheel”, “axle”, “tree”,“father”, “carry”, “see”, “know”, and so on. Words for less concreteaspects of the world were a long time coming. The adjective for “big”in Indo-European, for example, was “mega”: the root of our“megabyte”. This is an abstract word because it can apply to manydifferent kinds of concrete objects; both bears and wheels can be big.Many centuries passed before humans were able to extend this to thevery abstract concept of “bigness” or “size”: a general noun for anabstract quality. In Homer, who composed his poems about 3,000 yearsago, the noun “bigness” ( megathos ) refers only to the height of human',\n",

Each time theword was stretched, and each advance toward greater abstraction wasa tiny victory for poetic genius, and contributed to the richness andpower of our language today.

The problem of change from conservation is important because it articulates early notions of conservation and because itexposes a strange tension, a new-oldness buried deep in thenature of change. Another problem of change As the ancient Greeks struggled to detail a theory of change theystumbled on a more subtle issue that might be called the problem ofchange from contradiction (Sorabji calls it “the problem of stoppingand starting”).

II.Motion : change is the motion of atoms through the void, that is, their rearrangement. III.Bonds : the atoms have “hooks and barbs” and can clump together into stable, large bodies. These ideas were so novel in 600 BCE that the atomists needed to coin new words to express them. Their atoms were supposed to bevery tiny, and impossible to break or cut. The first syllable of “atom”means “not”, just as in the English word “amoral” and the secondsyllable “tom” is from the Greek verb “to cut”. So “atom” literallymeant the “uncut” or “uncuttable”.

Their second new idea led to a furious controversy in which many of the themes of this book were voiced for the first time. What does itmean to say that the void exists? If a void is just emptiness, canemptiness exist? In struggling to answer these questions, atomistsfinally developed a concept of the void that was an importantforerunner of our modern “space”.

Most historiansagree that this interpretation of Zeno is correct, but philosophers stilltend to treat the above paradoxes as if they were merely puzzles aboutmotion through space and time.

But if theyare as many as they are, they will be limited.

And these separators too must be distinct from thethings they separate (if not, there is no separation), and are thereforejust more things among the many. But then they in turn must beseparated from the others, and an infinite regress follows: they areunlimited in number.

This sort of answer shows an immediate link to the paradox of plurality above, and suggests thatthe paradoxes of motion are related to the deeper problem of the oneand the many.

The paradox of the arrow can be understood in the following way. A motion seems to involve both diversity and unity. It is easy to seehow diversity is involved because the motion traverses many places ortakes many moments. It is less easy to see the role of unity. A motioncan be a smooth and unbroken whole, as Aristotle thought, and ittraverses its whole route during a whole period of time.

Even after Einstein revealed the New Testament ofrelativity theory, the deep framework of Newton’s vision remainsbasic to all of physics.

Thus the marriage ofDiana is earlier than her death because there is a relation between thetwo events that fixes their order.

Here we discuss the question of whether absolutes canbe justified within classical Newtonian physics, and then we return torelativity theory. Newton’s absolute space scandalized good empiricists and positivists.

A milestone in philosophy of space and time was passed when a strong consensus emerged that the above inference was a mistake,thus robbing relationalists of a central weapon. One major reason isthat philosophers now agree that substantivalism can be slimmeddown and stripped of its superfluous structure. This lean and meansubstantivalism can withstand empiricist arguments from the natureof motion. Thus within  classical physics  the arguments do not justify abandoning all structures over and above bodies and their relations. This puts pressure on relationalism. If absolutes are to be aban- doned altogether, it must be because of something new about relativ-ity theory. Empiricism alone is not sufficient to banish absolutes.

The bang produced by thedrumstick is a local occurrence, but the response is global. In general relativity, mass produces curvature the way that the drumstick depresses the drumhead. The resulting curvature ofspacetime, however, depends on the shape of the whole universe , just as the drum’s tones depend on the shape of the whole drum.

General relativity is a local theory : it tells how each little patch of spacetime is attached to its neighbours. This sort of theory leaves agreat deal of global freedom .

Unfortunately forrelationalists, this freedom has also given scope for the constructionof non-standard models. These are models of the universe that agreeat each point with general relativity’s local predictions but havebizarre global features. Some of these models prove that generalrelativity retains a role for absolutes. In particular, absolute accelera-tion seems to have reared its head again, and confirmed Newton’soriginal claim that accelerations are evidence for spatial and temporalstructures independent of their contents.

This point is found by starting at 2 and movingalong POS \\uf0a2 to find out where the back of the car is “at the same time”. Thus the length of the car for the passengers is the distance from 2 to3. Note here that the back of the car is well outside the garage (it doesnot enter until 4).

Finally, note that the order in which events occur in time may depend on the plane of simultaneity. If we use horizontal planes ofsimultaneity (and the vertical t-axis), the car enters the garage at 1, then the rear of the car enters the garage at 4, and only later does thefront of the car hit the back of the garage at 2. This is shown on thegraph by 2 being above 4, which is above 1. All of this is consistentwith the car being shorter than the garage.

       "[['Among physicists, Einstein is at times remembered as a grumpy, cutting and arrogant fellow with little patience for family orcolleagues. He so annoyed his teachers at university that he failed tosecure a job in academia, and had to scramble to find low-payingwork in the Swiss patent office (although some say that being Jewishhurt his chances too). During his twenties in Berne, Einstein was afashionable man about town. His wit and violin playing brought himmany dinner invitations, and he formed a reading group with friendsto study the work of Kant, Schopenhauer and other philosophers. In1905, his miracle year, he published several unrelated papers. Onewas good enough to win a Nobel prize, and another revolutionizedour views of space and time. The 25-year-old patent clerk had remadephysics in his own image. Einstein’s 1905 theory of space and time is now called the  special theory of relativity . The word “relativity” refers to relative speeds and',\n",
       "  'Einstein’s writings Einstein’s original papers on the special and general theories are surprisingly accessible, and should be read or skimmed by allstudents. Several key papers are included in the inexpensiveThe Principle of Relativity  (Dover, 1952) including Minkovski’s 1908 paper and others. Einstein’s own introduction, listed above, isquick reading and a useful snapshot of his approach. A readablecollection of his non-technical, personal and political writings can befound in C. Seelig (ed.), Ideas and Opinions (Bonanza Books, 1954). Einstein’s collected works are being published by Princeton UniversityPress.

Pais,  Subtle is the Lord: The Science and Life of Albert Einstein  (Oxford University Press, 1982) is a lively, technical work by a prominent physicist whoworked with Einstein.']]"
